# SSBM-Input-Buffering
A capstone project to add input buffering into Super Smash Bros. Melee.

The code here is converted in hex using MCM and imported into the game through there.

Capstone updates posted at my blog: http://jsteelsmith.cikeys.com/

# Installation requirements:
If you would like to try the mod for yourself, you will need three things:
- MCM (Melee Code Manager)
- Dolphin emulator
- A copy of SSBM

## Melee Code Manager:

## Dolphin Emulator:
https://dolphin-emu.org/

## A copy of SSBM:
You can search the internet for guides on how to do this.

# How to install:
After installing Dolphin and downloading MCM, follow these steps:
1. Extract MCM anywhere
2. Download "Input Buffer.txt" (https://github.com/RockAndRoll805/SSBM-Input-Buffering/blob/master/Input%20Buffer.txt) and place the text file in the "Mods Library" folder inside of where you extracted MCM
3. Open MCM
4. Open your Melee ISO inside of MCM
5. Go to the "Input Buffer" tab, click on the "Input Buffering" mod, then click save

Now when you open Melee in Dolphin, the mod should automatically work in the background. This mod is currently incompatible with the FasterMelee and Slippi builds of Dolphin.
