# SSBM-Input-Buffering
WIP mod to add input buffering into Super Smash Bros. Melee.

The code here is converted in hex using MCM and imported into the game through there.

Right now buffering jump is working, rest of the moves are in progress. Specials are taking me the most time to get into a working state. I am almost done with buffering all the grounded special moves.

Code in place here currently only works for player 1.
